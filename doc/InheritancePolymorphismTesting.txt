Conditionals and Polymorphism

Premise: Most ifs can be replaced by polymorphism

Why?
Functions without ifs are easier to read
Functions without ifs are easier to test
Polymorpihc systems are easier to maintain

Use polymorphism
If an object should behave differently based on its state
If you have to check the same condition in multiple places

Use conditionals
Mainly to do comparisons of primitive objects: >,<.==,!=
There other uses, but today we focus on avoiding if

To be if free
Never return a null, instead return a Null Object, e.g. an empty list
Don't return error codes, instead throw an Exception (RunTime please!)

Rampant subclassing
Polymorphism uses subclassing
Be careful about runaway  subclassing(another talk focuses on that)

State Base Behavior:
      Replease conditional with polymorphism
      You have a conditional that chooses different behavior depending on the type of an object.
      Move each leg of the conditional to an overrideing method ina subclass. Make the original method abstract.

double getSpeed() {
       switch (_type) {
       	      
	      case EUROPEAN:
	      	   return getBaseSpeed();

	      case AFRICAN:
	      	   return getBaseSpeed() - getLoadFactor() * _numberOfCoconuts;

	      case NORWEGIAN_BLUE:
	      	   return (_isNailed) ? 0 : getBaseSpeed(_voltage);

       }
       throw new RuntimeException("Should be unreachable");
}
